# CS4242 Machine Learning for Interactive Systems
Working in groups of 2 create an interactive system that uses machine learning. Your system
should demonstrate your ability to choose a relevant supervised machine learning technique
[classification, regression, dynamic time warping], and to train and run a model.

The system may be a game, a prototype for some commercial application, a piece of art, a
system for performing experimental music with, a system that helps explain ML to a student,
a critical artwork that serves as a provocation to consider the potential effects of AI and ML
in society, etc.

Your system and the accompanying report should also demonstrate your research and
exploration of an idea or topic that you are interested in. For example, if you are building a
system to explore classification of hand gestures, your report might present your research on
different approaches to hand gesture recognition, existing commercial approaches,
particular difficul2es, new developments etc. If you are using faceOsc, your report might
present your research on the ethics of facial recogni2on, the development and deployment
of this technology etc.
